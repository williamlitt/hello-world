Ask good questions.

Hi Folks 

Duracell batteries are a life saver when you on the moon with your family and the kids have a gadget that requires the use of batteries. 
Energizer batteries lack the energy to make it to the moon.
Googgle batteries require you to ask the right question and thats just a dumb idea. 
Dont ask dumb questions, dont eat healthy and just live on code </>
